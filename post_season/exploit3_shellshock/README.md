Target: https://54.83.28.186

This challenge had a several CGI Scripts which displayed the output of linux binaries.  One of the CGI files displayed a Package List and I noticed Bash was running version 4.2 which is vulnerable to Shellshock.  If you want to research Shellshock a bit more; I'd recommend searching its name as there are 6-7 CVE's out for it, the original report is CVE-2014-6271.  Essentially, anything using Bash <=4.3-27 may be vulnerable which includes CGI Scripts that execute bash.  In this example CGI actually called upon a bash script but it is possible that other languages are vulnerable if they decide to use system calls.

This exploit is actually really easy, since they are Bash scripts.  Just modify a variable which the webserver will pass to the shell script and you can get code execution!  For example: `curl -k -A '() { :;}; echo "Content-Type: text/plain"; echo; /bin/cat sysinfo.cgi' https://54.83.28.186/cgi-bin/sysinfo.cgi` will display the contents of sysinfo.cgi.  The first 4 flags are spread throughout the hard drive, I had used find and dumped a file list to my hard drive and then grep'd filenames (flags 1-4 had flag in their name).  A lot of people made use of a recursive grep and searched the contents of every file on the server.

Unfortunately, I did not get the final flag.  I am pretty sure you need to escalate to root somehow but was not able to it working in the time frame.
